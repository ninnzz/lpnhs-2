# Surname HW 2
# Given the following variables, do the needed operation

####### Numericals

# NOTE: You can assign multiple variables at once
a, b, c, d, e, f = -55.5, 188.2, 25, 90.3, 15, 4

# The product of b and c divided by the 
# sum of a and d
print(f"Answer is: ")

# Convert product of b and d to integer
print(f"Answer is: ")

# Print 123^-456 (123 raised to the negative 456th power)
n = 0.00 # Change this
print(f"{n}")

# Print the answer when you divide a by d. Print only up to 2 decimal places
print(f"The answer is: ")

# Print the remainder when you divide e by f
print(f"The remainder is: ")

####### Strings
# You need to do some research on some part

s1 = "what"
s2 = "food"
s3 = "do"
s4 = "you"
s5 = "like"

# Print the entire statement in one line. "What food do you like?"
print()

# Print all the combinations of sentences that you can form using s1 to s5
print()

grt = "What a nice day"
# Print the third word only!
# Hint, strings are just groups of characters. You can google the answer.
print(grt)

# Print the total number of letters including spaces of the variable grt
# Hint, there is a buitin function to count the number of elements on a list
print(grt)


####### Operators

g, h, i, j, k = 3, 4, 16, "hello", "four"

# Fill in the blanks
# Modify the operator to print the result
if g == 4:
    print("Four is the bigger number!")

if i / h > 4:
    print("The result is 4")

if not((len(j) == 5) and (g + i < 100)):
    print("Correct!")

if k is str(h):
    print("Correct!")
